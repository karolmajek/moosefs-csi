# Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for MooseFS

[Container storage interface](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec) is an [industry standard](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md) that enables storage vendors to develop a plugin once and have it work across a number of container orchestration systems.

[MooseFS](https://moosefs.com) is a petabyte Open-Source distributed file system. It aims to be fault-tolerant, highly available, highly performing, scalable general-purpose network distributed file system for data centers.

MooseFS source code can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/moosefs/moosefs).

---

*Note that a pool of MooseFS Clients that are available for use by containers is created on each node. By default the number of MooseFS Clients in the pool is `1`.*

## Changelog

Driver verson 0.9.7
* Added support for MooseFS 4 client.
* Enabled passing additional mfsmount parameters during the mount process (password and more).
* Support for cross-platform compilation has been enabled.
* Repository images support AMD64, ARM64 and ARMv7 architectures by default.

## Installation on Kubernetes

### Prerequisites

* MooseFS Cluster up and running

* `--allow-privileged=true` flag set for both API server and kubelet (default value for kubelet is `true`)

### **Deployment**

1.  Edit `deploy/kubernetes/csi-moosefs-config.yaml` config map file with your settings:

    * `master_host` – domain name (**recommended**) or IP address of your MooseFS Master Server(s). It is an equivalent to `-H master_host` or `-o mfsmaster=master_host` passed to MooseFS Client.
    * `master_port` – port number of your MooseFS Master Server. It is an equivalent to `-P master_port` or `-o mfsport=master_port` passed to MooseFS Client.
    * `k8s_root_dir` – each mount's root directory on MooseFS. Each path is relative to this one. Equivalent to `-S k8s_root_dir` or `-o mfssubfolder=k8s_root_dir` passed to MooseFS Client.
    * `driver_working_dir` – a driver working directory inside MooseFS where persistent volumes, logs and metadata is stored (actual path is: `k8s_root_dir/driver_working_dir`)
    * `mount_count` – number of pre created MooseFS clients running on each node
    * `mfs_logging` – driver can create logs from each component in `k8s_root_dir/driver_working_dir/logs` directory. Boolean `"true"`/`"false"` value.

2.  Apply csi-moosefs-config config map to the cluster:

    ```
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/csi-moosefs-config.yaml
    ```

    Check the config map status:

    ```
    $ kubectl get configmap -n kube-system
    NAME                                 DATA   AGE
    csi-moosefs-config                   6      42s
    ```

3.  Update `deploy/kubernetes/csi-moosefs.yaml` file with the aproprieate image:

    The default image consists of the latest version of the CSI plug-in and the latest version of the MooseFS Community Edition client:

    * Locate image definition under the `csi-moosefs-plugin` plugin name(line 230 and line 323)
      `mage: registry.moosefs.com/moosefs-csi-plugin:0.9.7-4.56.6`
    * Update the `image` version suffix in the plugin's section accordingly:
        * `0.9.7-3.0.118`      – plugin version 0.9.7 and MooseFS CE 3.0.118
        * `0.9.7-4.56.6`       – plugin version 0.9.7 and MooseFS CE 4.56.6
        * `0.9.7-3.0.118-pro`  – plugin version 0.9.7 and MooseFS PRO 3.0.118
        * `0.9.7-4.56.6-pro`   – plugin version 0.9.7 and MooseFS PRO 4.56.6

      You can find a complete list of available images at: \
      https://registry.moosefs.com/v2/moosefs-csi-plugin/tags/list.

      **Note there are two occurrences of `csi-moosefs-plugin` in `csi-moosefs.yaml` file and it is necessary to update the image version in both places of the file.**

4.  Deploy CSI MooseFS plugin along with CSI Sidecar Containers:

    ```
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/csi-moosefs.yaml
    ```

5.  Ensure that all the containers are ready, up and running

    ```
    kube@k-master:~$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep csi-moosefs
    csi-moosefs-controller-0                   4/4     Running   0          44m
    csi-moosefs-node-7h4pj                     2/2     Running   0          44m
    csi-moosefs-node-8n5hj                     2/2     Running   0          44m
    csi-moosefs-node-n4prg                     2/2     Running   0          44m
    ```
   
    You should see a single `csi-moosefs-controller-x` running and `csi-moosefs-node-xxxxx` one per each node.

    You may also take a look at your MooseFS CGI Monitoring Interface ("Mounts" tab) to check if new Clients are connected – mount points: `/mnt/controller` and `/mnt/${nodeId}[_${mountId}]`.

### **Verification**

1.  Create a persistent volume claim for 5 GiB:

    ```
    $ kubectl apply -f examples/kubernetes/dynamic-provisioning/pvc.yaml
    ```

2.  Verify if the persistent volume claim exists and wait until it's STATUS is `Bound`:

    ```
    $ kubectl get pvc
    NAME             STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS      AGE
    my-moosefs-pvc   Bound    pvc-a62451d4-0d75-4f81-bfb3-8402c59bfc25   5Gi        RWX            moosefs-storage   69m
    ```

3.  After its in `Bound` state, create a sample workload that mounts the volume:

    ```
    $ kubectl apply -f examples/kubernetes/dynamic-provisioning/pod.yaml
    ```

4.  Verify the storage is mounted:

    ```
    $ kubectl exec my-moosefs-pod -- df -h /data
    Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on
    172.17.2.80:9421          4.2T      1.4T      2.8T  33% /data
    ```
   
    You may take a look at MooseFS GUI Monitoring Interface ("Quotas" tab) to check if a quota for 5 GiB on a newly created volume directory has been set.
    Dynamically provisioned volumes are stored on MooseFS in `k8s_root_dir/driver_working_dir/volumes` directory.
   
5.  Clean up:

    ```
    $ kubectl delete -f examples/kubernetes/dynamic-provisioning/pod.yaml
    $ kubectl delete -f examples/kubernetes/dynamic-provisioning/pvc.yaml
    ```

## More examples and capabilities

### Volume Expansion

Volume expansion can be done by updating and applying corresponding PVC specification.

**Note:** the volume size can only be increased. Any attempts to decrease it will result in an error. It is not recommended to resize Persistent Volume MooseFS-allocated quotas via MooseFS native tools, as such changes will not be visible in your Container Orchestrator.

### Static provisioning

Volumes can be also provisioned statically by creating or using a existing directory in `k8s_root_dir/driver_working_dir/volumes`. Example PersistentVolume `examples/kubernetes/static-provisioning/pv.yaml` definition, requires existing volume in volumes directory.

### Mount MooseFS inside containers

It is possible to mount any MooseFS directory inside containers using static provisioning.

1.  Create a Persistent Volume (`examples/kubernetes/mount-volume/pv.yaml`):

    ```
    kind: PersistentVolume
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: my-moosefs-pv-mount
    spec:
      storageClassName: ""               # empty Storage Class
      capacity:
        storage: 1Gi                     # required, however does not have any effect
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteMany
      csi:
        driver: csi.moosefs.com
        volumeHandle: my-mount-volume   # unique volume name
        volumeAttributes:
          mfsSubDir: "/"                 # subdirectory to be mounted as a rootdir (inside k8s_root_dir)
    ```
   
2.  Create corresponding Persistent Volume Claim (`examples/kubernetes/mount-volume/pvc.yaml`):

    ```
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: my-moosefs-pvc-mount
    spec:
      storageClassName: ""               # empty Storage Class
      volumeName: my-moosefs-pv-mount
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteMany
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi                   # at least as much as in PV, does not have any effect
    ```   
   
3.  Apply both configurations:

    ```
    $ kubectl apply -f examples/kubernetes/mount-volume/pv.yaml
    $ kubectl apply -f examples/kubernetes/mount-volume/pvc.yaml
    ```
   
4.  Verify that PVC exists and wait until it is bound to the previously created PV:

    ```
    $ kubectl get pvc
    NAME                    STATUS   VOLUME                 CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
    my-moosefs-pvc-mount    Bound     my-moosefs-pv-mount   1Gi        RWX                           23m
    ```
   
5.  Create a sample workload that mounts the volume:

    ```
    $ kubectl apply -f examples/kubernetes/mount-volume/pod.yaml
    ```
   
6.  Verify that the storage is mounted:

    ```
    $ kubectl exec -it my-moosefs-pod-mount -- ls /data
    ```
   
   You should see the content of `k8s_root_dir/mfsSubDir`.
   
7.  Clean up:

    ```
    $ kubectl delete -f examples/kubernetes/mount-volume/pod.yaml
    $ kubectl delete -f examples/kubernetes/mount-volume/pvc.yaml
    $ kubectl delete -f examples/kubernetes/mount-volume/pv.yaml
    ```

By using `containers[*].volumeMounts[*].subPath` field of `PodSpec` it is possible to specify a proper MooseFS subdirectory using only one PV/PVC pair, without creating a new one for each subdirectory:

```
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: my-site-app
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-frontend
          # ...
          volumeMounts:
            - name: my-moosefs-mount
              mountPath: "/var/www/my-site/assets/images"
              subPath: "resources/my-site/images"
            - name: my-moosefs-mount
              mountPath: "/var/www/my-site/assets/css"
              subPath: "resources/my-site/css"
      volumes:
        - name: my-moosefs-mount
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: my-moosefs-pvc-mount
```
